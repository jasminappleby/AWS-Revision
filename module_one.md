- On-demand Delivery: AWS has the resources available whenever you need them. You can return them when you no longer need them anymore. 

- Cloud-based deployment: Everything runs on the cloud. Can be an old hybrid/on-prem solution which has been migrated to the cloud, or something built from scratch.

- Hybrid deployment: Connects cloud-based and on-premise solutions. Integrates legacy infrastructure to cloud infrastructure. 

- On-Premise deployment: Everything runs from an on-premise data centre.


## Benefits to Cloud Computing 

- Trade upfront costs with variable expense: Eliminate upfront costs of data centres and hardware, and only use the AWS Cloud infrastructure which will lower costs as you are instantly paying for what you are going to use, rather than estimating how much capacity you need.

- Stop spending money maintaining data centres: Similarly, you eliminate costs of running that data centre.

- Stop guessing capacity: No need to estimate how much RAM or compute time, as AWS is pay-as-you-go. You will only pay for what you are using. If you switch it off, charges stop occuring. 

- Benefit from massive economies of scale: Due to millions of people using AWS Cloud, the price can aggregate in the cloud and therefore can reduce overall costs for everyone. 

- Increase speed and agility: Access new resources in minutes rather than weeks that it could take on an on-prem solution. 

- Go Global in Minutes: Deploy to customers globally in minutes providing them with low-latency.
